# Tic Tac Toe


## [Click to see](https://statesmans.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

#### Implement a five-in-a-row tic-tac-toe game in JavaScript on the NxN field  (N must be configurable in the user interface). The implementation should cover the entire game process, "like adults" - the start screen, the game  completion screen, the ability to start a new game, interrupt the current one, etc.

## Be a plus:
- no page reloading on user actions
- use canvas
